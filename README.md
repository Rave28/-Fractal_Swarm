# 🌌 The V2 Fractal Swarm Architecture

This repository contains the definitive V2 Swarm Protocol developed by **Rave28 & Antigravity**.

The Fractal Swarm is an autonomous, deterministic, self-correcting agentic assembly line that mandates a strict **Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act -> Verify -> Memorize** OODA loop to prevent AI hallucination and infinite regression.

## 🧠 Core Components

- **`/core/oracle/vibe_backend`**: The Sovereign Oracle. A local FastAPI gateway interfacing with ChromaDB for 2026 state-of-the-art Python/Rust paradigms and Sonar-Pro for live web intelligence. Implements a blazing-fast Tier 1 Semantic Cache intercept.
- **`/core/nanobots/DeepCode`**: The Hands. The fast, highly deterministic code modification subsystem that acts upon Oracle blueprints to conduct multi-file batch writes via `asyncio`. Safe environments are strictly enforced.
- **`/core/brain/myBrAIn`**: The internal intelligence and memory management core logic.
- **`/docs/protocol`**: The definitive `.antigravityrules` engine configuration that enforces the V2 cycle constraints.
- **`/pipelines/sandboxes`**: Test environments validating synchronous vs. concurrent `asyncio.TaskGroup` architectures.

## 🛠️ The Orchestrator

Located at `/tools/orchestrator/swarm_init.py`, the Swarm CLI rapidly spins up an isolated Python 3.13 `uv` environment, prepping *any* local directory for instant DeepCode nanobot engagement and testing.
