Fractal Swarm is not a coding assistant. It is a mathematically bounded, cryptographically sealed, auto-healing multi-agent software factory.

Built on a rigorous **OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)** state machine, the Swarm runs locally, governs its own logic via strict AST boundary guards, ingests the web autonomously, and trades cryptographic vector memory with foreign AI nodes.

## 🛡️ Core Capabilities

* **AEGIS Governance (Zero-Trust AI):** Every line of AI-generated code must pass a rigorous Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Boundary Guard before touching the disk. Destructive filesystem operations (like `os.remove` or `subprocess.run`) are hard-blocked without a cryptographic capability token.
* **The OODA Loop Engine:** Nanobots do not guess. They map the disk geometry, query the local semantic cache, spike-test hypotheses in isolated sandboxes, and batch-write architecture in sub-second bursts.
* **Semantic Namespacing:** Your ChromaDB vector memory is strictly partitioned by workspace using an LRU-cached resolver. Zero cross-project hallucination.
* **Nightcrawler Daemon:** An autonomous background process that visually drives the web (via Gemini 3 Auto-Browse) to synthesize state-of-the-art documentation and burn it into your local cache while you sleep.
* **A2A Cryptographic Trading:** Autonomous Agent-to-Agent vector bartering secured by SHA-256 payload hashing and strict 300s TTL replay shields.
* **Auto-Heal CI/CD:** A native GitHub Action (`fractal_heal.yml`) that intercepts failing PR tests, diagnoses the stack trace, clears the AST guard, and autonomously pushes hotfixes to `main`.
* **Sovereign Dashboard:** A decoupled, glassmorphic React/Vite HUD rendering live nanobot telemetry, vector cache states, and security audit streams in real-time.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Transform your standard OS into a Sovereign AI Node in under 3 minutes.

### 1. Clone the Hive

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rave28/-Fractal_Swarm.git
cd -Fractal_Swarm
```

### 2. Terraform the OS (Windows)

Open an Administrator PowerShell and execute the global setup to bind the Swarm aliases to your system profile:

```powershell
.\setup_global_swarm.ps1
```

### 3. Boot the Oracle

Silently spin up the FastAPI Knowledge Broker, the ChromaDB vector hive, and the Nightcrawler daemon in the background:

```powershell
swarm-boot
```

### 4. Inaugurate a Workspace

Open any blank directory on your machine and initialize it. This injects the .antigravityrules protocol and seals the namespace.

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\my_new_startup
swarm-init .
```

Your local IDE agent is now bound to the Fractal Swarm OODA loop. Drop a prompt and watch the nanobots build.

## 🧠 The Sovereign Dashboard

To monitor the Swarm's live telemetry, AST guard blocks, and vector memory ingestion, launch the HUD:

```powershell
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:5173> to view the live Security Audit Feed.

## 📊 Certification

Fractal Swarm v1.2.0 is fully certified against a rigorous 44-point stress harness, guaranteeing mathematically bounded chunking (force_split), namespace isolation, and zero-trust cryptographic A2A trades.
