# 🌌 FRACTAL SWARM v1.2.0

**Stop babysitting your AI. Build a cryptographically sealed, auto-healing software factory on your local machine.**

Current AI coding agents are glorified auto-complete tools. They suffer from fatal flaws: they hallucinate context across different projects, they blindly overwrite established architecture, and they cannot be trusted with autonomous execution because they might delete your root directory.

**Fractal Swarm v1.2.0 solves this.** It is a locally hosted, multi-agent Operating System driven by an **OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)**. It governs its own logic via strict AST boundaries, ingests the web autonomously, and visualizes its decision-making in real-time.

## 🛑 The Pain & 💊 The Swarm Solution

Here is exactly how Fractal Swarm fixes the broken state of AI software engineering:

### 1. The Rogue AI Problem

* **The Pain:** You give an AI agent terminal access, and it accidentally hallucinates an `os.remove()` or destructive shell command, nuking your virtual environment.
* **The Swarm Solution (AEGIS AST Guard):** Zero-Trust AI. Every single line of code generated by the Swarm is intercepted by an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser before it touches your disk. If it detects unauthorized side-effects, it hard-blocks the execution and forces the AI to rewrite.

### 2. The Semantic Pollution Problem

* **The Pain:** You ask your AI a question about your React frontend, and it hallucinates an answer using Rust code because it read your backend files yesterday. Its memory is a messy, global soup.
* **The Swarm Solution (Semantic Namespacing):** Your local ChromaDB vector hive is strictly partitioned by workspace IDs. When you initialize a project, it is mathematically isolated. The AI becomes physically blind to your other projects unless you explicitly engage the `--global` God-Mode flag.

### 3. The Knowledge Decay Problem

* **The Pain:** Your AI is stuck on a knowledge cutoff date. It doesn't know the new framework documentation released yesterday, causing it to write deprecated, broken code.
* **The Swarm Solution (Nightcrawler Daemon):** An autonomous background process that visually drives the web (via Gemini 3 Auto-Browse). Point it at the newest documentation URL before you go to sleep; it will chunk the text safely (`force_split`) and burn the state-of-the-art knowledge directly into your local vector cache.

### 4. The "Broken Build" Pipeline

* **The Pain:** You push code, CI tests fail, and a developer has to wake up, read the logs, and write a patch.
* **The Swarm Solution (Auto-Heal CI/CD):** A native GitHub Action (`fractal_heal.yml`) that intercepts failing PR tests, pipes the stack trace to a Sequential Thinking node, clears the AST guard, and autonomously pushes a hotfix to `main` without human intervention.

## 🎛️ The Sovereign Dashboard

Fractal Swarm doesn't just work in the shadows. It includes a decoupled, glassmorphic React/Vite HUD that streams live telemetry directly from your OS.

* **Security Audit Feed:** Watch the AST Guard block or pass nanobot payloads in real-time.
* **Memory Log:** Visually track the vectors the Nightcrawler daemon is actively ingesting.
* **System Telemetry:** Live CPU, RAM, and ChromaDB capacity monitors.

## 🚀 Quickstart: Terraform Your OS

Transform your standard machine into a Sovereign AI Node in under 3 minutes.

**1. Clone the Hive**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rave28/-Fractal_Swarm.git
cd -Fractal_Swarm
```

**2. Bind the Swarm (Windows)**
Open an Administrator PowerShell to register the Swarm commands to your OS profile:

```powershell
.\setup_global_swarm.ps1
```

**3. Boot the Oracle & Dashboard**
Silently spin up the FastAPI Knowledge Broker, ChromaDB, and the React HUD:

```powershell
swarm-boot
```

*(Navigate to <http://localhost:5173> to view the live dashboard).*

**4. Inaugurate a Workspace**
Open any blank directory on your machine and initialize it. This locks the workspace into the Swarm's namespace and unleashes the nanobots.

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\my_new_startup
swarm-init .
```

## 🤝 Acknowledgments & The Giants

Fractal Swarm leverages bleeding-edge open-source tools and foundational Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Absolute credit belongs to the original architects:

* **DeepCode:** For the underlying file-system mapping frameworks that give the Swarm its "hands."
* **MyBrAIn:** The foundational ChromaDB vector-memory implementation we adapted for Semantic Namespacing.
* **Sequential Thinking (MCP):** The dynamic cognitive-loop protocol that grants the Swarm its ability to reason autonomously.
